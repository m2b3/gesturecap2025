# GestureCap OSC

Run MediaPipe locally, route gesture data in Max/MSP, and control audio, visual, or other parameters.

GestureCap OSC packages the MediaPipe tracker so it can run locally without sending camera data to a cloud service. The tracker can be launched directly from Max/MSP, embedded in a Max Project, or included in a standalone application.

The repository connects three main stages:

```text
Local MediaPipe tracking
        ↓ OSC — 127.0.0.1:11111
Gesture routing matrix
        ↓
12 custom parameter dials
        ↓
Audio, visuals, or other processes
```

By default, tracking and OSC communication stay on the local machine. Camera frames are processed locally and only landmark data is sent to Max.

## Quick Start — Complete Project, No Python Installation

The recommended download is the ready-to-run macOS Apple Silicon package:

```text
gesturecap-osc-v0.1.0-macos-arm64-complete.zip
```

1. Download the complete package from the [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/mikaelmolliex/gesturecap-osc/releases/latest).
2. Unzip it.
3. Open `max/GestureCap_Tracker_Test.maxpat` in Max/MSP.
4. Enable the camera/video control.

That is all. The complete release already contains the signed and notarized tracker at:

```text
dist/doublehand_mp/doublehand_mp
```

Python is not required on the performance machine, and no tracker folder needs to be moved. The first launch can take approximately 20–30 seconds while MediaPipe, OpenCV, and the packaged runtime load.

This ready-to-run build currently supports macOS Apple Silicon (`arm64`). If you only need the tracker for another Max Project, standalone, or OSC application, use the smaller tracker-only asset described in [Tracker-Only Download and Manual Integration](#tracker-only-download-and-manual-integration).

## Why This Repository

The main goal is to make a MediaPipe-based gesture pipeline portable and practical inside Max/MSP applications:

- Run hand tracking locally and privately
- Launch the packaged tracker from Max
- Embed the tracker in a Max Project or standalone application
- Visualize MediaPipe landmarks inside Max
- Route gesture axes to 12 destination parameters
- Calibrate and shape each parameter with custom JSUI dials
- Reuse the routing matrix with OSC, USB, or Bluetooth controllers

---

## Main Components

### MediaPipe Tracker

The packaged tracker runs MediaPipe and OpenCV locally. It supports up to two hands with 21 landmarks per hand and sends X, Y, and Z values to:

```text
/hand/left
/hand/right
```

Default OSC destination:

```text
127.0.0.1:11111
```

The tracker can display its own OpenCV preview while `mediapipe_handdraw.js` renders the landmark data inside Max/MSP.

### Gesture Routing Matrix

The routing matrix is designed primarily around MediaPipe data.

![GestureCap OSC routing matrix](media/routing-matrix.png)

Primary modes:

- **Hands** — direct access to the 21 landmarks of each hand
- **Clusters** — grouped MediaPipe sources for higher-level gesture control

Additional controller modes:

- **Wearable** — OSC data from wearable controllers
- **Gamepad** — USB or Bluetooth exploration and parameter control
- **Mouse** — manual exploration, testing, and parameter control

Each mode preserves its own active sources, selections, and mappings.

#### Matrix messages

The matrix accepts the following control messages:

| Message | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `mode hands` | Selects the Hands mode. Replace `hands` with `clusters`, `wearable`, `gamepad`, or `mouse` to select another mode. |
| `clear` | Resets LEDs, gates, selections, and mappings for the current mode. Colors are preserved. |
| `clearall` | Resets states and mappings for every mode. Colors are preserved. |
| `clearmappings` | Clears only the mappings for the current mode. Active LEDs, gates, and selections are preserved. |
| `rightborderactive $1` | Sets the active-border value for the right-hand side. |
| `leftborderactive $1` | Sets the active-border value for the left-hand side. |
| `rightborderinactive $1` | Sets the inactive-border value for the right-hand side. |
| `leftborderinactive $1` | Sets the inactive-border value for the left-hand side. |
| `rightbgactive $1` | Sets the active-background value for the right-hand side. |
| `leftbgactive $1` | Sets the active-background value for the left-hand side. |
| `rightbginactive $1` | Sets the inactive-background value for the right-hand side. |
| `leftbginactive $1` | Sets the inactive-background value for the left-hand side. |
| `rightcolor $1` | Sets the right-hand display color value. |
| `leftcolor $1` | Sets the left-hand display color value. |

In Max message boxes, `$1` is replaced by the value sent to the message.

See [Gesture Routing Matrix](docs/routing-matrix.md) for messages, outputs, colors, and state behavior.

### Custom Parameter Dials

Twelve reusable JSUI dials process normalized controller data through:

![GestureCap OSC custom parameter dials](media/custom-dials.png)

```text
Raw Input
→ Near / Far
→ Invert
→ Exponent
→ Playable Range
→ Unit Display
→ Triggers
```

See [Custom JSUI Dials](docs/custom-dials.md) for messages, outlets, and display behavior.

## Tracker-Only Download and Manual Integration

Use this section if you cloned a version of the repository without `dist/`, or if you want to embed the tracker in your own Max Project, standalone, or OSC application. Users of the complete ready-to-run package can skip this section.

### 1. Download the tracker-only asset

Download the smaller tracker package from the [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/mikaelmolliex/gesturecap-osc/releases/latest):

```text
gesturecap-tracker-macos-arm64.zip
```

To use it with this repository:

1. Unzip the archive.
2. Create `dist/` at the repository root if it is not already present.
3. Move the extracted `doublehand_mp/` folder into `dist/`.

This installation step is mandatory. The Max launcher cannot start MediaPipe until the executable exists at `dist/doublehand_mp/doublehand_mp`.

The current build is provided for macOS Apple Silicon (`arm64`). It is signed with an Apple Developer ID and notarized by Apple for distribution outside the Mac App Store.

The optional checksum asset is:

```text
gesturecap-tracker-macos-arm64.zip.sha256
```

To verify the download, place the ZIP and checksum file together, then run:

```bash
shasum -a 256 -c gesturecap-tracker-macos-arm64.zip.sha256
```

The expected result is:

```text
gesturecap-tracker-macos-arm64.zip: OK
```

The checksum verification is recommended but is not required to run the tracker. The archive contains `doublehand_mp/`; it does not create the parent `dist/` directory for you.

The final project structure must be:

```text
gesturecap-osc/
├── dist/
│   └── doublehand_mp/
│       ├── doublehand_mp
│       └── _internal/
└── max/
    ├── GestureCap_Tracker_Test.maxpat
    ├── run_mediapipe_maxmsp.js
    ├── mediapipe_handdraw.js
    ├── gesture_mapper_ui_multimode_extended.js
    └── custom.dial.v9.js
```

The complete `_internal/` directory must remain beside the `doublehand_mp` executable. Do not move the executable by itself.

On first launch, macOS may display its normal confirmation and camera-permission dialogs. If Gatekeeper reports that it cannot verify the tracker, confirm that you downloaded the current Release asset and that the SHA-256 verification succeeds. Do not replace the release signature with an ad-hoc signature.

### 2. Test with the included Max patch

```text
max/GestureCap_Tracker_Test.maxpat
```

### 3. Enable the camera/video control

Max launches the packaged tracker. The tracker opens its OpenCV preview and sends MediaPipe landmarks to the visualizer embedded in the Max patch.

The initial launch can take approximately 20–30 seconds while the packaged runtime, MediaPipe, OpenCV and supporting resources load.

### Tracker placement and launcher paths

For the regular Max patch, [`max/run_mediapipe_maxmsp.js`](max/run_mediapipe_maxmsp.js) resolves the tracker relative to the launcher script:

```javascript
const TRACKER_PATH = path.join(
    __dirname,
    "..",
    "dist",
    "doublehand_mp",
    "doublehand_mp"
);
```

The extracted executable must therefore exist at:

```text
dist/doublehand_mp/doublehand_mp
```

If the tracker is moved elsewhere, update the `TRACKER_PATH` block in the launcher that you use:

- [`max/run_mediapipe_maxmsp.js`](max/run_mediapipe_maxmsp.js) — regular Max patch; expects the tracker in `dist/doublehand_mp/` at the repository root.
- [`max/run_mediapipe_maxmsp_project.js`](max/run_mediapipe_maxmsp_project.js) — Max Project; resolves a bundled `tracker/doublehand_mp/` directory relative to the project launcher.
- [`max/run_mediapipe_standalone.js`](max/run_mediapipe_standalone.js) — standalone application; update the application name or absolute bundle path to match `YourApp.app/Contents/Resources/tracker/doublehand_mp/doublehand_mp`.

In every configuration, keep the complete `_internal/` directory beside the `doublehand_mp` executable.

See [Max/MSP Integration](docs/max-integration.md) for the regular patch, Max Project, and standalone launchers.

## Packaged Tracker and `dist/`

For the `v0.1.0` ready-to-run milestone, `dist/doublehand_mp/` is included in the release commit so the complete project works immediately after extraction. Other generated `dist/` outputs and local backups remain ignored.

The same signed and notarized tracker is also distributed separately as `gesturecap-tracker-macos-arm64.zip` for users who do not need the complete project.

Release workflow:

1. Build `doublehand_mp/` from the committed PyInstaller specification.
2. Sign the release build with a Developer ID Application identity and hardened runtime.
3. Verify the executable and test the complete generated directory.
4. Compress the signed `doublehand_mp/` directory as `gesturecap-tracker-macos-arm64.zip`.
5. Submit that exact archive to Apple's notary service.
6. Generate and verify `gesturecap-tracker-macos-arm64.zip.sha256`.
7. Attach the accepted archive and checksum to a GitHub Release.
8. Keep standalone ZIP and checksum assets outside Git history.

The unpacked tracker is approximately 217 MB. The release archive is smaller because it is compressed.

Future development versions may stop tracking `dist/` again. The `v0.1.0` tag will continue to preserve this ready-to-run milestone.

The current packaged tracker is built for macOS Apple Silicon (`arm64`). Intel macOS and Windows require separate builds and release assets.

Developers who want to run from Python source can use the repository's Python environment. See [Build Tracker on macOS](docs/build-tracker.md) for the PyInstaller workflow.

## macOS Standalone Deployment

For a standalone application, the tracker can be embedded at:

```text
YourApp.app
└── Contents
    └── Resources
        └── tracker
            └── doublehand_mp/
                ├── doublehand_mp
                └── _internal/
```

Camera access may require `NSCameraUsageDescription`, a camera entitlement, application signing, and a TCC permission reset during development. Embedding the already signed tracker does not sign or notarize the surrounding Max standalone application: the complete `.app` and its final distribution archive must follow their own Developer ID signing and notarization workflow.

See [macOS Camera Permissions](docs/macos-camera-permissions.md) for the complete workflow.

## Project Origin

GestureCap OSC is based on the original GestureCap project developed during Google Summer of Code 2025 under the INCF organization.

This repository includes work developed as part of my contribution to Google Summer of Code 2026. It extends the original pipeline with local OSC integration, Max/MSP routing, packaged tracker deployment, embedded visualization, and custom parameter interfaces.
